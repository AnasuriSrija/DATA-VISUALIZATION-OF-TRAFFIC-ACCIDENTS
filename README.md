# DATA-VISUALIZATION-OF-TRAFFIC-ACCIDENTS

# Overview
Traffic accidents result in significant loss of life and economic impact globally. This project visualizes accident-prone areas using geographic data to help identify patterns and support better traffic planning. Using Python and Folium, we generate interactive heatmaps from accident datasets based on location coordinates.

# Objective
- Visualize traffic accident locations using geographic heatmaps
- Identify high-risk zones through spatial clustering
- Enable stakeholders to take preventive and planning actions

# Web Application Stack:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSP
- Backend: Java, JSP
- Python Stack:
  - Data Processing: NumPy, Pandas
  - Visualization: Folium, HeatMap plugin
  - Utilities: Webbrowser, sys, OS

# Project Highlights
- Developed a data-driven web application and Python script to visualize road accidents using Folium for interactive heatmaps.
- Used NumPy and Pandas to clean and process accident datasets (lat/long, cause, time, speed).
- Generated browser-ready heatmaps showing accident-prone areas, enabling smarter decisions by authorities and planners.
