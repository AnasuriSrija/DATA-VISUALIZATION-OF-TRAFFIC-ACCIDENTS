# DATA-VISUALIZATION-OF-TRAFFIC-ACCIDENTS

# Overview
Traffic accidents result in significant loss of life and economic impact globally. This project visualizes accident-prone areas using geographic data to help identify patterns and support better traffic planning. Using Python and Folium, we generate interactive heatmaps from accident datasets based on location coordinates.

# Objective
- Visualize traffic accident locations using geographic heatmaps
- Identify high-risk zones through spatial clustering
- Enable stakeholders to take preventive and planning actions

# Tools & Technologies
- # Python - 3.x
- # Pandas – for data cleaning and processing
- # Folium – for interactive map creation
- # HeatMap Plugin – to render accident density
